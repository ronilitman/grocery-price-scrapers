"""Reaching back a day when the chain has not published today's files yet.

Netiv Hesed's portal shows one day at a time. Every other chain's serves a
rolling window - Super-Pharm keeps about three days - so a morning where
today's snapshot is late still lists yesterday's and nothing notices. Here,
between the midnight rollover and whenever the full set lands, the listing
holds nothing but hourly deltas.

On 9 September 2026 the chain published at 16:59 instead of its usual 05:25.
The 07:26 build found a page full of deltas, took none of them, and failed
three times; it was the chain's first night on the site, so there was no
artifact to carry forward either and it did not appear at all.

The fallback asks the portal for earlier days, which it will serve. What it
must not do is pass those files off as tonight's: the app's rule is that stale
prices are labelled, not hidden, and a consumer would otherwise stamp every
chain with the time of the run. So a scrape that reached back writes the day
down, and the note travels in the chain's raw package.
