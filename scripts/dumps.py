"""Keep only each branch's newest dump, and throw the superseded ones away.

The chains do not serve one file per branch, they serve a window of them.
Super-Pharm keeps about three days, Shufersal was still offering a file from
15 July, and Yohananof lists files from 2024 at the top of its directory. The
scraper takes everything the listing offers, so a run downloads the same branch
several times over - 909 PromoFull dumps for Super-Pharm's 307 branches.

Nothing downstream can reconcile that. A reader that walks every PromoFull
file adds each one's ``StoreID`` to the offer's branch set, and has no way to
tell a stale copy from a current one. So an offer a branch stopped running days ago stays attached
to that branch for as long as an old copy of its file is still being served.
That is not hypothetical: on 6 September the app told a shopper that Slim
Delice was ₪10 at Super-Pharm Givat Shmuel, from a promotion that branch had
dropped on the 4th and which we were still reading out of the 3rd's file.

Expiry does not save us. Dropping offers whose end date has passed is why
files from 2024 do no harm - but the ₪10 offer ran until 23 September, so it
sailed through.

Two rules, and the second matters more than the first:

  * A file's branch is read from the XML - ``<ChainID>`` and ``<StoreID>`` -
    never from its name. The name cannot be trusted for this: the same field
    is ``-000-152-`` at Super-Pharm, ``-066-`` at Bareket and ``-00-1-`` at
    Yohananof, whose filename also claims the chain is 0000000000000 while the
    document inside it says otherwise.

  * A file we cannot date is always kept. Filenames carry one of two stamps -
    ``20260907-071543`` or ``202609070502`` - and one pattern reads both; all
    30 files sampled across all 31 chains parsed. But that is one sample per
    chain, so anything unrecognised has to survive rather than be guessed at.
    A chain whose names we cannot read keeps every file and behaves exactly as
    it did before this existed.
