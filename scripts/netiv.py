"""Scrape נתיב החסד - and with it בר-כל and שירה מרקט - from its own portal.

The library ships a NETIV_HASED scraper but it points at ``141.226.203.152``,
which has answered HTTP 500 for long enough that the library disables the
chain outright: it is absent from ``ScraperFactory.all_scrapers_name()``, so
even asking for it by name gets nothing. The chain did not stop publishing, it
moved - gov.il now lists ``app.netiv-hesed.com``, whose own header reads
"אתר שקיפות מחירים נתיב החסד, ברכלטוב, שירה מרקט".

That is the only reason this file exists. Everything downstream is the
library's: the parser package still has a working NETIV_HASED parser, and the
file dialect it emits parses without a single override.

Two things about the portal are worth knowing before changing anything here.

**It is behind Cloudflare, and Cloudflare objects twice.** From a home
connection the ``python-requests`` and ``curl`` default UAs get 403 while an
empty UA, a browser UA and a made-up custom string all get
200 - so a request must never go out with the library's default header. That
looked like the whole rule and it is not: a GitHub runner is refused whatever
UA it sends, which is why the chain is in ``HOME_EGRESS`` and leaves through
the exit node. Both defences are live; satisfying one does not settle the
other.

**One page holds one day.** The index lists every file that day published -
roughly 560 - with no pagination, and a ``Date`` parameter asks for an earlier
one. It shows today by default, which is empty of snapshots until the chain
publishes them; see ``newest_day_with_files``. It also lists the hourly
``Price``/``Promo`` deltas, which we do not want: FULL snapshots only, for the
reason given at the top of fetch.py.

    Every other chain gets this for free. Their portals serve a rolling window
    - Super-Pharm keeps about three days, Shufersal has offered files weeks old
    - so a morning where today's snapshot has not landed yet still lists
    yesterday's, and dumps.prune_to_newest drops whatever is superseded. This
    portal shows one day at a time, so between the midnight rollover and
    whenever the full set is published its listing holds nothing but hourly
    deltas, and asking only for today means coming back empty.

    That is not hypothetical. The chain normally publishes at about 05:25; on
    9 September 2026 it published at 16:59, and the 07:26 build found a page
    full of deltas and no snapshot at all - the chain's first night on the
    site, so there was no artifact to carry forward either and it simply did
    not appear.

    Returns ``(day, names)``, where ``day`` is None if the portal's own default
    listing had the files and no date had to be asked for. Days are the
    portal's, not ours: it stamps its files in Israel local time and we only
    ever hand back what it agreed to serve.

    A day with no links at all is not treated as the end of the road - the
    chain does skip days, and a page with nothing on it looks the same as one
    Cloudflare intercepted. That only becomes an error if *no* day answered
    with a listing, which is the point at which "we are not being served" is
